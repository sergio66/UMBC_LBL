mkdir /home/sergio/SPECTRA/Global_Data_HITRAN2020/
look at the detailed Readme there -- reproduced below

cp -a /asl/data/hitran/H2020/QTIPS/*.[fF]* .
cp -a /asl/data/hitran/H2020/QTIPS/*.CMN .

mv BD_ISO_2020.for BD_ISO_2020.FOR
mv BD_ISO_82_to_85.for BD_ISO_82_TO_85.FOR

edit BD_ISO_82_TO_85.FOR (the "returns" and "continues" are wierd!!!!)

cp ../Global_Data_HITRAN2012/TIPS_2012_allisotopes.f TIPS_2021_allisotopes.f
wherever you see 2012, replace with 2021
      CALL TIPS_2021(iMol,rTemp,iI,iG*1.d0,rQT)
      include 'TIPS_2021_try_include1.f'   >>>>>>>>>>> which is basically TIPS_2021.FOR but turned into a subroutine, and edited as below

>>>>>>><<<<<<<

cp ../Global_Data_HITRAN2012/TIPS_2012_try_include1.f TIPS_2021_try_include1.f
basically keep the first few lines, change 2012 to 2021
and then
  delete everything, physically
  include TIPS_2021.FOR
  make the main program into subroutine, see below
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

C***********************
cs      Program TIPS_2021
C***********************
C    Program TIPS_2021 written by R.R. Gamache




C***********************
      Subroutine TIPS_2021(
     I MOL,             ! HITRAN molecule number
     I Temp,            ! temperature in K
     I NSO82,           ! isotopomer index  should really be eg 161 or 181 0r 171 for Water
     O gi,              ! state independent degeneracy factor
     O QT)              ! total internal partition sum
C***********************

then include and edit TIPS_2021.FOR

(1) these are new variables
      INTEGER NT,I,IT
      INTEGER MOL,NS082
      DOUBLE PRECISION Temp,QT,gi
      character*30 stopNgo
(2) these are redefined variabes
c      COMMON/TEMPERATURES/TDAT(NT)
      DOUBLE PRECISION tdat(NT)
      COMMON/Temperatures/tdat

      DOUBLE PRECISION tmax(NMOL,Max_ISO)
c      DIMENSION TMAX(NMOL,MAX_ISO)

(3) edit out their input prompts
     I have comments "cs" in columns 1-2, have demarcated them using
cs >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
cs >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
and set the isotope
cs       CALL ISO_82_TO_85 (MOL,NSO82,ISO)
         ISO = NSO82  !!! YAY NEED THIS since we are not using eg 161 171  but using 1 2 ....

(4) molecule 34 is a mess, the max temp was set at 10.0 and the gi,Q were set as 0. So edited this to become
c      data Tmax(34,1)/10./  ! HO2
      data Tmax(34,1)/1000./  ! HO2  SERGIO
and
      IF(MOL.EQ.34) THEN
      c...not applicable to O
      c      gi=0
      c     QT = 0.
      c sergio
            gi=1
            QT = 1.
       go to 100
      ENDIF

(5) modify the output lines so that nothing is printed from TIPS_2021_try_include1.f, and the loop does not keep executing
 100  if(QT .gt. 0.) then
cxsergio         WRITE(*,900) MOLID(MOL), NSO82, TEMP, QT, GI
cxsergio   900 FORMAT(//,5X,A6,' MOLECULE',3X,I5,' ISOTOPOLOGUE',/,
cxsergio      + 5X,'Q(',F7.1,' K) = ',1PE12.4,5X,'STATE INDEPENDENT FACTOR=',
cxsergio      + 0PF7.1,////)
      ELSE
        print *,NSO82, Temp, QT, gi
        WRITE(*,'(A23,A6)') ' NO DATA AVAILABLEFOR ',MOLID(MOL)
      ENDIF
c      go to 10
c  99  STOP 'Computation finished'

>>>>>>><<<<<<<

in BD_ISO_82_TO_85.FOR and BD_MOL_2020.FOR and BD_ISO_2020.for change all
           Species_2020.cmn to Species_2020.cmn
           Isotops.cmn      to Isotops.cmn
           MOLEC.cmn        to MOLEC.CMN
plus declare variables
     INTEGER NMOL,Max_ISO  into SPECIES_2016.CMN
