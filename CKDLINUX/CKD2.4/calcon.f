c these water subroutines calculate the continuum for WATER(ID=1)
c and are based entirely in the KCARTA routines, except NO jacobians

c similarly the O2 and N2 subroutines are based ENTIRELY on GENLN2 stuff

c note we are using        REAL CON(*),WHICHLAYER instead of
c                          REAL CON(KMAXLAYER,KMAXPTS)

c also real ------> real*8

c because of memeory problems 
c and so we do        DO 10 ILAY=whichlayer,whichlayer
c instead of          DO 10 ILAY=1,NLAY

c THIS IS JUST FOR THE O2/N2 continuums
