LOOK AT /home/sergio/SPECTRA/Global_Data_HITRAN2024/ from which I have copied eg Readme_complete_H2024_Setup_MOLGAS_XSEC_QTIPS_ISOTOPEMASS to 
        /home/sergio/SPECTRA/HITRAN_Database_important_scripts/2024/Readme_complete_H2024_Setup_MOLGAS_XSEC_QTIPS_ISOTOPEMASS

Make sure you update
  do_HITRAN_vers.m
  do_GEISA_vers.m  
  
since it is called by run8*.m to use latest HITRAN version, which is H2024 in January 2026

Note : cp qtips20.m    to        qtips24.m            and edit 20 --> 24
       cp find_qnewABCD_H20.m to find_qnewABCD_H24.m  and edit 20 --> 24

Edit and run << driver_test_run8_run8water_xsec.m >>  when happy

1) many (comparison) files have default HITRAN = 2020; change to HITRAN = 2024

2) Do things for NLTE
---------------------
Also need to do lots of things for NLTE
  See /home/sergio/KCARTA/NONLTE/M_Files_for_kcarta_NLTE_LBL_runs/ReadmeBlog
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

3) Do things for run8co2 including mkdir CO2_MATFILES/H24
---------------------------------------------------------

ALSO have to
  mkdir CO2_MATFILES/H20
    which gets populated by hitread.m + alreadyexist.m + makeDAVEhitlin.m
    very useful in making weakCO2 background for NLTE ....
    
    edit/run driver_makeDAVEhitlin.m and then move the files to eg H20 then do the symbolic links
    but be VERY CAREFUL about the subdirs ...
    
AND
  edit run8co2.m and run8co2_linemixUMBC.m so that the default HIT file/dir to read is
    /asl/data/hitran/h20.by.gas/g2.dat
