SAMPLE HITREAD : Sergio DeSouza-Machado, Dec 2021

Main Contents
  DATA
    g5.dat : HITRAN data for g5 (CO) stripped of any DOS characters
  C CODE
    Makefile : edit it so HDIR and MBIN are correct
               type "make" at the unix prompt
    alternatively, type "mex -compatibleArrayDims read_hitran.c hutils.c" at the Matlab prompt
    These both make the C reader "read_hitran.mexa64" which reads in the 160 character tape
  MATLAB CODE
    driver_findlines_plot.m  : << main driver that calls these next two files >>
                               can modify this to read in different wavenumbers (wv1,wv2) and/or gasID combinations as needed
    hitread.m                : calls one or both of [read_hitran.mexa64, read_hitran2.m] for CO
    translate2oldHITparams.m : translates the 15 character IUSGQ,ILSGQ into 3 characters
    read_hitran2.m           : alternative, Matlab based reader of 160 character HITRAN tape

            HITRAN Database Reader and Tools

                       Version 1.4
                     for HITRAN 2004

This distribution includes a Matlab HITRAN reader,some tools for
manipulating HITRAN files, and examples of using the Unix "sort"
utility to merge, update, or sort a HITRAN database.

The main pieces are

  read_hitr.txt    - more detiled information
  read_hitran2.m   - reference version Matlab HITRAN reader
  read_hitran.c    - fast C mex version of Matlab HITRAN reader
  hselect.c        - C source for the select utility
  CHANGES          - changes from HITRAN2K to HITRAN04

To compile the programs, check the path to the Matlab "mex"
compiler (the default is /usr/local/matlab/bin) in the Makefile,
and simply type "make".  The resulting mex file needs to be on
the Matlab search path.
