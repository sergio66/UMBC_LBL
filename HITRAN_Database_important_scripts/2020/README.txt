TIPS_2021 SOFTWARE

This program calculates the Total Internal Partition Sums (TIPS) for a given molecule,
isotopologue, and temperature. Current limitations are the molecular species on the
HITRAN molecular database plus a few additional molecules and the temperature range
is generally 1 - 5000 K.
