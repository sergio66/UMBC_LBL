Dear Colleagues,

  The new edition of the HITRAN database (HITRAN2016) has passed testing and is now available.

 This message gives you the instructions for accessing the HITRAN
 database compilation.  The current edition is HITRAN2016, and it can
 be accessed via our new dynamic web-interface HITRANonline at
 www.hitran.org . The line-by-line portion of HITRAN has now been cast
 into a new SQL structure that underlies this interface, and this has
 allowed us to add more information including sophisticated line-shape
 parameters. Particularly significant is that the amount of molecules
 for which we provide sets of IR cross-sections has increased six fold
 and is now over 300.
 
  Use of the HITRAN database is free.  We ask users to please cite the
  article describing the database when publishing or presenting
  results based on HITRAN.  This is a good idea in order to indicate
  to your readers which database, that is, which edition you have
  employed.  The article describing the 2016 edition of HITRAN is
  already accepted and available online in Open Access
  (doi:10.1016/j.jqsrt.2017.06.038). It will appear in print in a
  Special Issue of the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and
  Radiative Transfer that is expected to come out this year. The

We also request that users cite the original sources for the
parameters.  These references are efficiently provided for every
parameter in the line-by-line compilation and for the cross-sections.

It is also worth recalling that the HITRAN compilation also provides
collision-induced absorption data for many collisional pairs as well
as aerosol coefficients of refraction.

Detailed documentation is provided on the website along with auxiliary
programs. We especially want to point users’ attention to HAPI (HITRAN
Application Programming Interface) <http://www.hitran.org/hapi>. HAPI
is a set of routines in Python aimed to provide remote access to
functionality and data given by the new project HITRANonline.  HAPI
enables flexible downloading of data. It also offers much more
sophisticated processing of data taken from HITRANonline, including
the ability to calculate several types of high-resolution spectra and
convolved spectra, and the use of the flexible Hartmann-Tran profile
(HTP).

==> Note that we are still making ongoing improvements to many
molecular bands.  Updates, improvements, and corrections to the
edition are posted in the "Database Updates" panel located on the home
page of the HITRAN web-site.  When citing the database it is
recommended to indicate if an updated version of the HITRAN2016
edition was used.

Please e-mail to us (info@hitran.org) a summary of any serious
problems you encounter (or successes or suggestions).
